      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <!-- Intro --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px"> Over the years Gerrymandering, or the redistribution of district lines to favor a party or class, has been a high topic of debate. According to Emily Barasch, cases of gerrymandering have been found as far back as 1812. This case was performed by Governor Elbridge Gerry in Massachusetts; he manipulated a district which, when it was finished, looked like a salamander.(Barasch) Over the years many politicians have “gerrymandered” districts, with this tradition continuing every 10 years to this current day. Today the three main themes I have been finding on gerrymandering are about the misconceptions of it, the current popular solution: Math, and lastly answering the main question of gerrymandering: is it good for our political system. Although the literature on gerrymandering represents itself in different lights, the paper’s primary focus deals with how we can handle gerrymandering including multiple approaches and opinions.</h5>

      <h1>Explanations and Misunderstandings of Gerrymandering</h1>
      <!-- Res: 1 --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">As Americans we tend to take things as how we hear it in newspapers, the internet, and magazines; when it comes to gerrymandering we always think that gerrymandering is bad. In the article Gerrymandering Isn’t Evil by John Sides and Eric McGhee they make a very valid point that there are two types of gerrymandering. The first is called partisan gerrymandering which involves “redrawing district lines with the intention of increasing the number of seats for one party.”(Sides & McGhee ) This is the method that most people hear about, but there is another way that gerrymandering still takes place.  The second way is called bipartisan gerrymandering which “...seeks to protect incumbents of both parties by making every district safer for either a Democrat or a Republican.”(Sides & McGhee ). We as the American people would seek to have “safe” elections where there is neither packing, separating opposing parties across many districts, nor cracking, putting as many opposing party votes in one district as possible , in drawing district lines. Another misconception is pointed out by Philip Devoe in the article Gerrymandering Isn’t a Republican Problem. People believe that a “fair shape” is important when deciding where the district lines are drawn. This overall is not a great way to determine districts at all because normal shapes in itself are gerrymandering too. A great example of this is how many Democrats usually crowd in the cities so it would be easy to round them up in one district, but since it would be in a largely populated city, it would be much more unfair for Democrats to win since there are many more districts for other parties to win. Overall, I believe that people do have misconceptions about how gerrymandering is performed, but I think these are a few that are good misconceptions to clear up. </h5>

            <h1>The New Math of Gerrymandering</h1>
            <!-- Intro --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Recently one of the biggest solutions that has come up for gerrymandering is using math and statistics to test if the boundaries being currently drawn are too gerrymandered. According to Nate Cohn and Quoctrung Bui in the article “How the New Math of Gerrymandering Works” in the New York Times, the way the algorithm detects whether or not something is Gerrymandered is to calculate a state's efficiency gap. The authors state,
The efficiency gap measurement aims to summarize the effect of gerrymandering by identifying all of the wasted votes in victory and defeat for both parties. It then adds them up, finds the difference between the two sides, and divides that by the total number of votes in a state. This yields a single percentage figure: the efficiency gap.
The creators of the efficiency gap claim that any state with an efficiency gap of more than 7% is most likely Gerrymandered(Cohn and Bui). Although many people are in favor of this, there are still some who do not agree as well. In the article in Above the Law called “Is Math Legal? Gill v. Whitford Will Determine If We Can Have Nice Things” by Elie Mystal, the author fully agrees with using math, but still brings up some of the opposing sides’ points. Mystal paraphrased the opposition’s points herself saying,  “We’re going to tell an entire state that its districts are unconstitutional because of math? Not because of a principle or a maxim or a statutory interpretation but, MATH? If lawyers liked math, they’d have gone to business school.”(Mystal) Although this is not very formal, the point still stands that it is hard to tell a state that you cannot have a certain way of placing your boundaries because of math. Another point that is made in this article by Mystal is that “If you invalidate Wisconsin’s districts, then the floodgates are opened. At least one party in almost every state is going to challenge that state’s districts. And they’ll CONCOCT different formulas out of thin air to show that they are aggrieved. It’ll never end.”(Mystal) There are many people who do and don’t believe this is a good idea, but as a whole we still need to decide whether or not we should make this a thing.</h5>
