      <h1>Part I: The Description of CSUMB as a Discourse Community</h1>
      <!-- Intro --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Through much class discussion over the past few weeks, I define a Discourse community as a group of people that a person belongs to which shapes not only what the person says, but also their actions and how they say, what they say. Being a part of CSUMB’s Discourse means being in a Discourse of over 7,600 people but we can still communicate to anyone in the Discourse. Swales is one of the few people who studied Discourse communities and each Discourse community had six characteristics. Swales’ six characteristics that every Discourse community contains are: each community has a goal to accomplish, a way to communicate through all of its members, participatory mechanisms, genre's on how to complete said goals,  special language or a dialect when speaking to others in the group, and finally threshold of memberships (471-473). Swales’ characteristics really help us understand how we act when we are in a group. I will use Swales’ characteristics to describe and analyze how I am a part of CSUMB's community and how I act when I am around other students. </h5>

      <!-- 1 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Swales’ first characteristic states that in order for a Discourse community to be formed there needs to be a goal that everyone aims for in said Discourse community; at CSUMB the goal varies for everyone (471). One popular goal of the CSUMB Discourse community is to get a degree. For example students usually go to college and get a degree so that they can say and show that they have achieved finishing college so they can call themselves intelligent. Another popular goal of CSUMB students is that we really want to get a stable job. The students want a career such as a software engineer because not only does it provide a good stable income but it allows students to be able to explore the world and a student’s own options with their new-acquired funds. A last popular goal is to get away from home so that students don’t have to deal with their parents anymore and so that they can learn to grow up and take care of themselves. This will finally form them into the people that they need to be for society’s sake. </h5>

      <!-- 2 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Swales’ second characteristic states that there needs to be a way to communicate between members of the group (471-472). On CSUMB’s campus there are many ways to communicate with other students. The most common way that we communicate is through our classes and talk to each other physically. An example of this is how in HCOM 211 we can obtain new information and gain new perspectives on certain course material. Physically talking also brings about jokes and fun times as well; talking is not always entirely serious. Another way we communicate is through email which tends to be the most formal communication. We, as students, obtain email’s from other teachers and get information from the school, but we also email each other to catch up and see if we missed anything. Lastly we communicate by texting or group chats of some form. This way of communication is usually informal, and a great example of this is how myself and many others in the CS++ cohort are in a Snapchat group chat where we can message each other on what we missed, remind each other about due dates, or just joke around and have fun. </h5>

      <!-- 3 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">The third characteristic of Discourse communities, according to Swales, is that a Discourse community needs to have participatory mechanisms and there many things that I do as a student to participate at CSUMB (472). First of all to even be able to participate in anything else we need to pay tuition. For the college to be able to keep running as it does it needs money so the college can keep functioning, but also so we can have better teachers and more activities on campus. A second participatory mechanism is to attend class and do homework. A way I am participating in this community right now is by writing this essay. A last common way to participate in school is by getting involved in a club or another organization. This can be as simple as joining the competitive programing club and taking part in talking about how to solve certain problems, but this can also include getting involved at the OC3 because you want to study abroad at some point. </h5>

      <!-- 4 char--><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px"> Swales’ fourth characteristic of Discourse communities talks about what genre Discourse communities’ use to further its’ aims or accomplish its goals (472-473). One of the main ways we have to accomplish our goals by being CSUMB students is to do so respectfully. This is especially important not only to be respectful to teachers, but also be respectful to other students because that helps build unity amongst one another which allows us to better each other. A second way that CSUMB students accomplish their goal is to do so carefully because if we are not careful especially as freshman then we may not do well in college. A great example of this is we have to be careful to get enough sleep, and overall take care of ourselves because if we do not then it makes it harder to focus on school. We also need to be careful because if we do not we could also get involved with a friend group that distracts us from the CSUMB Discourse communities’ goals. Lastly we have to be CSUMB students persistently for quite a few reasons, but the main reason is because we need to stand out amongst the other students is so that we can better ourselves which makes us look better not only for businesses, but also breaks the stereotype that college students don’t work well.</h5>

      <!-- 5 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">The fifth characteristic of Swales’ claims how each Discourse community needs some sort of  “acquired specific lexis” meaning that there is some specific and odd language to outsiders (473). First off there are the multitude of otter puns. This is just about everywhere on campus, for example: in dorms you can see such posters as “you otter know your RA’s” and other people who don’t like the puns might respond with “You otter not make another otter pun”. Secondly people on campus often talk about classes by referring to their number and letters. If talk about HCOM 211 to my friends at CSUMB they know exactly what I’m talking about, but my mother would not get that I’m talking about my english class. Lastly, all of the acronyms that we use on campus are very hard for outsiders to learn at first. For me now it makes sense, but if I was to talk to my brother about saying I’m going to the DC after class he may be really confused about where I was going, because I would probably not go to the capital of the United States. I would probably have to explain I was going to get food. </h5>

      <!-- 6 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Lastly Swales talks about how there needs to some sort of threshold of membership (473). Overall the college is split into four groups. There are the Freshman who are very new to the school and don’t know where everything is. There are the Sophomores who somewhat know what they are doing but still don’t have all of the info of the school and don’t entirely know what they want to do. The Juniors think that they know everything, but eventually hit very hard classes and to which they stress out on school.  Lastly Seniors or super Seniors are really done with school and are ready to just leave the university. They tend to be semi-slacking their last year but still know that they need the credits to graduate so they work somewhat hard, but there are some who overall accept they they have to grow up and are excited about their future and work hard during this year. </h5>

      <h1>Part II: The Analysis of CSUMB as a Discourse Community:</h1>
      <!-- Intro --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">To me the CSUMB student body Discourse community is still very new, and I still have much to learn. Being here already for about 2 months I have learned a lot. So far I have enjoyed most every minute of it and has overall pushed me to become more matured in my schoolwork, allowed me learn new information , and lastly overall changed my lifestyle for better or worse. </h5>

      <!-- Res: 1 --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">In the CSUMB student Discourse community many problems do arise, overall they help us learn and grow when we share our opinions on how to solve these problems. The CSUMB discourse community has really any topics you can think about through the classes we take and therefore we can talk about most all topics and discuss them. Such as when most of the people in a certain class don’t understand a certain assignment, but one person does. That one person then can come and tutor the others on how to do a certain type of problem. As for issues, problems, or concerns: when a person’s future is impacted by a certain external force they also come together as an opposing force. A great example of this is how the DACA is currently being jeopardized so a lot of the ‘dreamers’ would march around the school chanting on how we should save the DACA. New knowledge can mean a multitude of different ideas. It can be anything from learning how to program to new ways of looking at current events, to even just new life skills. New knowledge can be really anything that was not known before. There are a few way on how this new information can be obtained. One way it is created is through communication of thoughts and ideas. This expands our mind to not only think about our own world through our eyes, but also through everyone else’s eyes. Another way we can do this is through just learning through the institution itself. This could involve going to school and just learning the material, but this can also be through other places such as clubs or many other types of programs on campus. Overall this gives me multiple ways to learn so much new information through the CSUMB student discourse community. </h5>

        <!-- Res: 1 --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">In the CSUMB Discourse community there were many aspects that changed my normal discourse, or manner of speaking from what it was. One of the many ways that it did change my discourse is it changed how I talked to many students. At first I felt very not normal. I am usually a very literal person and I take things directly, but being by people who joke non-stop it made me have to become not as much of a literal person. Another way that it impacted me is it formed me to say “no” much more often. I am usually pretty open to helping out anyone in need. I found out very quickly that I couldn’t help everyone with everything, and I had to say no to some people, especially if they are really behind, or just don’t care about their schooling. I lastly have also needed to learn how to expand my vocabulary, not only in just classes such as HCOM 211, but also programing vocabulary. This has helped me succeed in the institution which has allowed me to grow more as a person, more into an intelligent individual, and overall helped me communicate with others who are a part of the discourse community.<h5>
