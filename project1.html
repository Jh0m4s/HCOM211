      <h1>Part I: The Description of CSUMB as a Discourse Community</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Through much class discussion over the past few weeks, I define a Discourse community as a group of people that a person belongs to which shapes not only what the person says, but also their actions and how they say, what they say. Being a part of CSUMB’s Discourse means being in a Discourse of over 7,600 people but we can still communicate to anyone in the Discourse. Swales is one of the few people who studied Discourse communities and each Discourse community had six characteristics. Swales’ six characteristics that every Discourse community contains are: each community has a goal to accomplish, a way to communicate through all of its members, participatory mechanisms, genre's on how to complete said goals,  special language or a dialect when speaking to others in the group, and finally threshold of memberships (471-473). Swales’ characteristics really help us understand how we act when we are in a group. I will use Swales’ characteristics to describe and analyze how I am a part of CSUMB's community and how I act when I am around other students. </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Swales’ first characteristic states that in order for a Discourse community to be formed there needs to be a goal that everyone aims for in said Discourse community; at CSUMB the goal varies for everyone (471). One popular goal of the CSUMB Discourse community is to get a degree. For example students usually go to college and get a degree so that they can say and show that they have achieved finishing college so they can call themselves intelligent. Another popular goal of CSUMB students is that we really want to get a stable job. The students want a career such as a software engineer because not only does it provide a good stable income but it allows students to be able to explore the world and a student’s own options with their new-acquired funds. A last popular goal is to get away from home so that students don’t have to deal with their parents anymore and so that they can learn to grow up and take care of themselves. This will finally form them into the people that they need to be for society’s sake. </h5>
