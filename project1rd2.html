      <h1>Part I: The Description of CSUMB as a Discourse Community</h1>
      <!-- Intro --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Through much class discussion over the past few weeks, I define a Discourse community as a group of people that a person belongs to which shapes not only what the person say, but also their actions and how they say what they say. Being a part of a university Discourse means being in a Discourse of over 7,600 people but we all can still communicate to any of us. Swales is one of the few people who studied Discourse communities and each Discourse community had six characteristics. Swales’ six characteristics that every Discourse community contains are that each of them have a goal to accomplish, a way to communicate through all of its members, participatory mechanisms, genre's on how to complete said goals,  special language or a dialect when speaking to others in the group, and finally threshold of memberships. Swales’ characteristics really help us understand how we act when we are in a group. I will use Swales’ characteristics to describe and analyze how I am a part of CSUMB's student body and how I act when I am around other students.
    </h5>

      <!-- 1 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Swales’ first characteristic states that in order for a Discourse community to be formed there needs to be a goal that everyone aims for in a Discourse community and at CSUMB the goal varies for everyone. One popular goal of the CSUMB Discourse community is to get a degree. For example students usually go to college and get a degree so that they can say and show that they have achieved finishing college so they can call themselves intelligent. Another popular goal of CSUMB students is that we really want to get a stable job. The student body wants a stable job such as a software engineer because not only does it provide a good stable income but it allows students to be able to explore the world and a student’s own options with their new-acquired funds. A last popular goal is to get away from home so that students don’t have to deal with their parents anymore and so that they can learn to grow up and take care of themselves. This will finally form them into the people that they need to be for society’s sake.
    </h5>

      <!-- 2 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Swales’ second characteristic is that there needs to be a way to communicate between members of the group. On CSUMB’s campus there are many ways to communicate with other students. The most common way that we communicate is through our classes and talk to each other physically. An example of this is how in HCOM 211 we can obtain new information and gain new perspectives on certain course material. Physically talking also brings about jokes and fun times as well and is not entirely serious. Another way we communicate is through email which tends to be the most formal communication. We, as students, obtain email’s from other teachers and get information from the school, but we also email each other to catch up and see if we missed anything. Lastly we communicate by texting or group chats of some form. This is usually informal, and a great example of this is how myself and a lot of people in the CS++ cohort are in a Snapchat group chat where we can message each other on what we missed or just joke around and have fun.
    </h5>

      <!-- 3 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">The third characteristic of Discourse communities according to Swales is that a Discourse community needs to have participatory mechanisms and there many things that we do as a student body to participate at CSUMB. First of all to even be able to participate in anything else we need to pay tuition. For the college to be able to keep running as it does it needs money so the college can keep functioning, but also so we can have better teachers and more activities on campus. A second participatory mechanism is to attend class and do homework. A way I am participating in this community right now is by writing this essay. Lastly another common way to participate in school is by getting involved in a club or another organization. This can be as simple as joining the League of Legends community and parting in talking about the current meta but this can also include getting involved at the OC3 because you want to study abroad at some point.
    </h5>

      <!-- 4 char--><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px"> Swales’ fourth characteristic of Discourse communities talks about what genre Discourse communities’ use to further its’ aims or accomplish its goals. One of the main ways we have to accomplish our goals by being CSUMB students is to do so respectfully. This is especially important not only to be respectful to teachers but also be respectful to other students because that helps build unity amongst one another which allows us to better each other. A second way that CSUMB students accomplish their goal is to do so carefully because if we are not careful especially as freshman then we may not do well in college. A great example of this is we have to be careful to get enough sleep, and overall take care of ourselves because if we do not then it makes it harder to focus on school. Lastly we have to be CSUMB students persistently for quite a few reasons, but the main reason is because we need to stand out amongst the other students is so that we can better ourselves which makes us look better not only for businesses, but others as well.
    </h5>

      <!-- 5 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">The fifth characteristic of Swales’ claims how each Discourse community needs some sort of  “acquired specific lexis” meaning that there is some specific and odd language to outsiders. First off there are the multitude of otter puns. This ranges from in dorms such as you “otter know your RA’s” to other people that don’t like the puns who say “You otter not make another otter pun”. Secondly people on campus often talk about classes by referring to their number and letters. I talk about HCOM 211 to my friends and they know exactly what I’m talking about, but my mother would not get what I’m talking about. Lastly, all of the acronyms that we use on campus are very hard for outsiders to learn at first. For me now it makes sense but if I was to talk to my brother about saying I’m going to the DC after class he may be really confused about where I was going to because I would probably not go to the capital of the United States. I would probably have to explain I was going to get food.</h5>

      <!-- 6 char --><h5 class="w3-padding-32", style="text-indent: 40px">Lastly Swales talks about how there needs to some sort of threshold of membership. Overall the college is split into four groups. There are the Freshman who are very new to the school and don’t know where everything is. There are the sophomores who somewhat know what they are doing but still don’t have all of the info of the school and don’t entirely know what they want to do. The Juniors think that they know everything, but eventually hit very hard classes and to which they stress out on school.  Lastly Seniors are really done with school and are ready to just leave the university. They tend to be semi-slacking their last year but still know that they need the credits to graduate.</h5>
